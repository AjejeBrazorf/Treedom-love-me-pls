        "Hi! I am the hammock guy! \n My name is Giuseppe and I am a Front End developer with 3.5 years of working experience.\n" +
        "\nI have been based in Utrecht for 2 years and I am looking forward to relocating back to Italy!\n" +
        "\nOur climate needs fast, sustainable and effective actions.\nI want to be contributing to those actions with curiosity and my best efforts.\n" +
        "\nTherefore I would like to apply for the position of Front End developer at Treedom.\n",
    story:
        "Since High school times, Front End has been a funny hobby together with anything that had to do with visuals (drawings, 3D, photography ecc..).\n" +
        "\n" +
        "After getting a master degree at Politecnico di Torino, Front End development finally became a profession.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "I started working for a small creative agency, having the chance to develop their website's Front End but also take care of UI e-commerce projects.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "During the same period I've been collaborating with a consultancy company which gave me the opportunity to work around Italy for a banking project.\n" +
        "Here I used for the first time Angular as a framework in a professional environment.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "After one year and a half I moved to the Netherlands, joining a team of highly skilled and passionate developers who gave me the power to love Linux, open source and a problem solving oriented mentality.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "During the last two years I intensified the knowledge over Angular but also touched other parts of the development process as e.g. joining the UI/UX design sessions.",
